Project "my_google_homepage" is the first project on TheOdinProject. In this project I'm building my version of the Google homepage, using HTML and CSS.

- Use the tips listed in the lesson.
- Use google.co.uk as an example page.
- Don't forget to push the project once done!

- After this project is done, I should also do the optional, more difficult version in the lesson - Google search results project.
